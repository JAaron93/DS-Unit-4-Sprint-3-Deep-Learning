BiLSTMs effectively increase the amount of information available to the network, improving the context available to the algorithm (e.g. knowing what words immediately follow and precede a word in a sentence).\n",

You also have to use a version of lstm seq2seq models known as [**transformers**](https://towardsdatascience.com/transformers-141e32e69591). Transformers give seq2seq models the capacity to pay attention to specific portions of the input sequence, the most relevent portion in order to make a prediction.

Although **we will cover the endcoder/decoder framework in a future lesson, transformers are outside the scope of Unit 4**. However, once you learn about LSTMs and encoder/decoder frameworks, you will have all necessary information to then go on and learn about transformers on your own.
